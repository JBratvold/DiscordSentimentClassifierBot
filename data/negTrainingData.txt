My classmates and I wanted to go and sit down somewhere, so we chose this place. Huge regret, as we waited over an hour for simple dishes, and as indigenous people, it was upsetting seeing white people being served before us. They did not want to give us a refund, but we demanded, and we walked back into class late. I think they need new people running that place, it was absolutely a horrible experience.

I can't believe this place is so bad.
Asked them to change my block heater cord, they gave me a quote. But instead, they changed just the plug, which I could have done in 10 min and for $6. But they charged me the quoted price. Nothing better than getting ripped off right before Christmas
Wanted an easy fix, but istead got ripped off. They over charged me, and stole my money. Bad reputation and do not trust them anymore.
My sister took her car here for a power steering leak, they said they needed to pressure test the power steering system to find the leak. They charged a full hour at their absolutely ridiculously high shop rate when it should have only taken 15 minutes to look and see what hose is wet and leaking (not rocket science). The bill came out to be $200 more then what other shops said it would be. When I went with my sister to pick up the car and ask why the price was so high the owner (Rob) was very rude and talked down to me like I didn't have a clue what I was talking about. He kept trying to say they charge so much because of the "warranty" they give. But other shops could replace the same line twice for the price they charged. After I told Rob that neither my sister or myself would be back there for service he didn't care. Some business owner he is if he doesn't care about his customers. At Glenwood Auto they will do anything they can to jack up the price of the repairs your vehicle needs and be ignorant and rude. Wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. TERRIBLE SERVICE.
Asked for a simple fix, but got ripped off instead. So annoyed. Do not trust this person anymore.
I got ripped off so bad.
Too slow, and always out of stock.
So gross. Nothing better than getting ripped off right before Christmas. Do not recommend.
Charged me way more than I should have been charged. Very frustrated, disappointed and annoyed. Avoid at all costs.
You suck!
This place used to be fast and efficient but now management is sinking this place. Slow service, long waits and often menu items are out of stock.
It is just not great anymore. The place is sinking quickly. Slow service, long waits. Just bad. Not coming back.
Bad management, not impressed. They are also very slow. Had to wait a long time for my food.
How do you guys live with yourself.
You guys suck so much!
I wouldn't return again.
Lousy location. Very boring and nothing to do. Not fun.
This is so frustrating.
It was so frustrating.

Nice try, but it was terrible.
It was terrible.
It was just terrible.
It was an ok attempt, but overall it was really bad, and not good.
Obviously new ownership, been twice in last month not going again, pasta all around the table was not prepared like it used to be. And chicken fettuccine tasted fishy. Dish with muscles were not cleaned.
I feel the quality of service has declined in a big way compared to a few years ago. For example, today I gave two orders. They brougt one of my orders wrong, and forgot to bring another order which made us wait way longer than usual wait time for the food to get ready. Also, when I wanted to give the 3rd order a few minutes after the 2nd order was put on our table, despite calling several times, I had to go to the front desk to give my order because no one paid attention to us and we were ignored. In addition to these, they also don't bring your order on time most of the time. The wait time is now way longer than before. The quality of customer service is getting poor.
This was the second time we tried Chianti’s since change in ownership, we will never return.  Several Tables that sat down after us got their food before we did and then when we did get our food , mine was cold. They wouldn’t do anything about it and didn’t apologize or offer a discount.  We will not be returning.
Ugh this place is a sad excuse for Italian food its like a taco bell of Mexican food. The fettuccine was so disgusting and the sauce I had was also gross. I should of known when i saw the banner for $10 pasta that it wouldn’t be of decent quality. If you’ve ever had real Italian food or higher quality establishments do not even try it here.
Ordered food through skip the dishes, had an issue, got a credit through skip the dishes and reordered at chianti.  The food arrived in a timely matter, but the food was tasteless and the sauces for the pasta was water and flavorless.  The bruschetta was hard and tasteless.  No going back
The clamaari was the worst tasteless stuff I've ever had. The salad was putrid and uninspiring. Just bad all around.
Food was not bad. Service was non existent.
Awful experience.
I wish I was dead.
This just reminded me of being dead.
I just felt dead it was so terrible.
It looked appalling.
Went there for supper on Monday. After waiting for our meal for an hour and a half we decided to leave. The owner would not even apologize for the terrible service and told us that they were busy so we shouldnt complain. When i told him i wouldnt pay for the glass of wine i drank without an apology he called the cops and reported me.    What customer service.
This place used to be so good. Now when you order the food is rotten. I had rotten chicken balls from here not to long ago. Recently rotten beef soup. Both times they refused to refund my money or exchange the food. The waiter is rude and unprofessional. This place is scary to go to anyways since in down town and there's alot of crime. Might aswell go to 8th st or 51st. So unimpressed I hope people domt go here..
I've been a loyal customer for over 2 years.  Eat there at least twice a week.  Last 5 times we've gone, the food has been ok..but the service has been terrible.  Everything from getting our order wrong (I order the exact same thing EVERYTIME) to being completely ignored.  Today we came in, ordered, had to ask for our drinks 2 times and asked for our appetizer 3 times.  We got our drinks 3/4 of the way though the meal.  The last time we asked where are appetizers are, after seeing the table behind us, who came in 20 min after we did, get their appetizers, we were told that they had the bigger table so they get service first.  The appetizer came after we finished our meal and were putting our coats on ready to leave.  We told the server we didn't want it and that is was supposed to be served before our lunch, so he threw it on the table and walked away.  When I complained to the clerk at the front, she said sorry in a very dismissive way and made no attempt to make it better.  I paid full price for everything.  All I was looking for was a heart-felt apology would have been good enough for me, but was dismissed.  You lost a loyal customer today.
My friend and I went to this shoppers, and we were browsing the makeup and the perfume section, just looking for something to do, and the lady working the makeup section followed us around to the point where we felt uncomfortable, as if she was breathing down our neck, not even giving good customer service. My friend is a person of colour, and she felt extremely targeted, as we were just looking for something to do. The employee shot us dirty looks, and made us so so uncomfortable to the point where we just left because it was so embarrassing. Do better Shoppers, at least train your employees on loss prevention properly and not make it obvious LOL.
Me and my mother stopped in to pick up a last-minute birthday card, just after 6:30 this evening - and in store full of other shoppers, the security guard decided to stand 3 feet away and watch my mother read birthday card. This was absolutely racial profiling as we all know birthday cards are not a high-value item. My mom felt uncomfortable and said she wanted to leave, so we left without purchasing any birthday card. This is unacceptable and we will be avoiding Shoppers Drug Marts whenever possible.
What happened to this place?!?! Upon walking in you see the patio which is now treated as an overcrowded storage space..tires, chairs, old equipment and the lounge has almost turned into the same. This should of been my first clue to not come in. Take some pride in your restaurant and keep things clean and tidy. There were 3 servers in the restaurant when we came with only two other tables, service was HORRIBLE. We sat with empty drinks the majority of the time and took forever for anything to come out. Food was also horrendous, choose a cuisine and stick with doing that well. Changing up the menu to include different fusions is not benefitting this restaurant or the restaurant patrons at all. Gross watered down sauces and overcooked pasta is all you will get here with poor drinks and service from servers who have attitude.  May seem like a good deal, but save your money and go elsewhere. Better off with a box of KD at home over this place.
Walked in the door at 4:40pm. Hostess seemed flustered given it was not at all busy. Tables were not clean. Table had half glasses of water with some oil (no bread) waited 20 minutes and no one came to our table to take our order or even bring some bread. We decided to leave as we did not want to wait 1 hour for food
After ordering we waited for 1h 30m for the kids food. 2 pizza's and one order of fries and chicken strips, all arrived cold. Then 30minutes after that the 4 adults meals showed up. After having to ask for our refill of pops and complaining about the service and food. They took the two pizza's and chicken strips off the bill. I was so mad at this point for waiting 2h for the food I didn't eat my order but still had to pay for it. The sauce was more like a week flavored water and looked more like pasta soup. Free dissert was offered but at this time it was after 8:30pm on a Sunday with young kids and we just wanted to get out of there. The dessert wasn't taken. While we were sitting waiting for our food. the patio heater outside was to close to the window causing it to break right behind my daughters head. Making a load noise and scaring her. The whole experience was horrible. I remember having such a great time here not sure what went wrong.  Will not return and hope other not to eat there. They need to reevaluate there kitchen staff and quality of food and service. Woke up this morning still mad about my experience.
I was a bit dissapointed in the item.
What a mess of a place, feels dirty with torn seating and empty napkin holders and menu pages that stick to one another.
Didn't like it very much.
This restaurant has sadly gone down hill with its weird asisn twist. Look i love asian food and i love italian food but pick one, they do NOT work together and right now both cuisines suck. Will it save chiantis, probably not, cause whoever decided this mess will still be the owner
This place has gone so far downhill.  The prices are still high. The food took over an hour, and we had to ask for it to go.  The excuse was that they had a lot of skip the dishes orders. We were given a card to get a free pasta.  Will NOT go again.
Not the best.
Worst pasa i've had at a restaurant. Ordered a white creamy sauce pasta with peas, mushroom and scallops. Scallops were the size of the peas and the mushroom was old. It had brown spots on it. The sauce was very thin and not creamy at all. Tasted like sauce from a store bought Jar. Definitely not worth trying. I should have listened to the bad reviews.
Worst service ever. Didn’t even get seated. Waited over 25 min just to be acknowledged.  We were told abruptly by the owner that he didn’t want to overwhelm his servers when we went to give our name for a table. (Table for 2) the restaurant wasn’t even half full.  Literally barely anyone in there. So sad as it was a favourite but will not darken their doors with my presence again.
I am not one to complain as I understand things happen But!!!.  We were seated and I sat down only to find I sat in something sticky. I think it was red wine vinegar and olive oil.  My pants totally ruined.  I then ordered veal and I could not cut the veal it was so tough. Not edible.  My husband ordered calamari, completely cold.   They comped my meal but what about the cost of my pants.  I was really disappointed.  The owner never even offered to cover the cost of my pants.
Does not have any battery life.
Ordered food and the Alfredo sauce was watery and bland. The only things that were good were the free bread and cheesecake. So disappointed. Will not be back here. You can get better sauce from the store

Happened to us twice that we did not get everything in our delivery order even when we were charged full price, When I phoned the first time I gave them the benefit of the doubt, but the second time they were rude and not taking any responsibility for it. Had to pay for a meal both times without receiving it as they would not give a refund or send over the missing dish. Will not be ordering from here again.
So I got food from here.. got hme opened it and found a hair first thing.. right on my Vietnamese roll. They weren’t wearing masks when I entered and they are supposed to be!
My sister and I ordered supper at 5pm and we're told it could be an hour to hour half for delivery. At 630 we called for an update and were told it was out for delivery. Thinking it's only 20min across the city we called at 705 and the staff stated again its out for delivery that they don't have drivers. When asked what company we can contact to complain about the delivery driver they said they don't know and to call back at 3pm Tues and maybe he'd have time to help us then. At 730 we called back again to tell them the food hadn't arrived and we no longer want it as I had to leave for work and there are kids that need to eat and go to bed for school...again all he'd say is OK it's out for delivery. They insisted the drivers take one order at a time.
Went to there other restaurant on circle what a waste of time .food in cheap enough 17.00 but wasn.t hot and bbq pork was tough would have sent back but waitress never returned to table .wasn.t busy .ate most of soup and left would not recommend at all .
If I could give no stars, I would. My partner and I ordered from here today for lunch. Unfortunately, it was not as good as I remember Thiens being about 2-3 years ago. Their business was booming during that time. When our food arrived, it smelled weird. We both ordered noodle bowls, I had a BBQ chicken, and my partner had the pork. First few bites were alright until we dug deeper in our bowls and saw that the greens were completely old and wilted. This is disgusting. I'm not sure how this happens, or how they could allow such poor quality food to leave the kitchen. You can clearly see that the greens are old through the transparent container. This is crazy to me. I will no longer be ordering from Thiens, what a waste of money.
Bad Bad Bad
Really bad service I got here. I was picking up food and requested for using their washroom and got told it’s only for customers, while I’m not a customer if I’m picking up food for a customer that was ordered from that restaurant. Absolutely hated that moment.
Everything about this place was bad. Bad food, bad smell, bad tables, bad seating, bad lighting, bad experience, bad life. And whats even worse is how bad the waitress was. So bad.
Ordered from here some years back, and went to pick up my order. Was told that in case they missed anything, just call! I got home and was missing two of my dishes. No big deal, I thought! I called and let them know what I was missing, and who I can only presume was the owner started yelling and cussing at me, accusing me of trying to rip him off. Still haven't been back since. I'll never support a restaurant that treats paying customers that way!
Horrible service! Pretend they care lol This is one of spot I used to go for soup, not very authentic but bearable, but not sure when CHEF has CHANGED, new chef definitely don't know how to make these Asian soup, nor noodle. Very disappointed on food taste and poor service.

I am absolutely furious with the abysmal service I received! This company is a disgrace. Their incompetence knows no bounds. From the moment I walked in, I was met with a staff that clearly despised their jobs. They were rude, unhelpful, and utterly clueless. And the product? It was a total waste of money. Poor quality, shoddy craftsmanship, and it fell apart within days. Don't waste your time or money here; you'd be better off burning it. I'm appalled by this place and will tell anyone who will listen to steer clear of this wretched establishment.
I cannot emphasize enough how utterly disappointed I am with the entire experience I had with this company. From start to finish, it was a nightmarish ordeal that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.  First off, their customer service is a joke. When I called to inquire about their products, the person on the other end of the line sounded like they couldn't care less about my questions. They provided vague and unhelpful answers, leaving me more confused than when I started. It was like they were actively trying to deter me from making a purchase.  Unfortunately, I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and proceeded with an order. That was a grave mistake. The shipping process was a complete disaster. My order arrived weeks later than the promised delivery date, and when I finally received it, the packaging was battered and torn. It was evident that they had zero concern for the condition of their products during transit.  Now, let's talk about the quality of the product itself. It was nothing short of a rip-off. The item looked nothing like the images on their website � it was poorly constructed and looked cheap. After just a few days of use, it started falling apart. The craftsmanship was abysmal. It was evident that they had no quality control in place, or they simply didn't care about the shoddy work they were sending out to customers.  The return process was yet another nightmare. When I attempted to contact their customer service for a return, I was met with indifference and was passed around from one representative to another, each offering a different set of instructions. It took me several weeks of back-and-forth emails and countless phone calls to finally initiate a return, and even then, they charged me for return shipping.  It's clear that this company cares more about making a quick buck than about their customers' satisfaction. I felt like I was being scammed at every turn, and the entire experience left a bitter taste in my mouth.
I would strongly advise anyone considering doing business with this company to run in the opposite direction. Their terrible customer service, shipping delays, subpar product quality, and convoluted return process make for an infuriating and disappointing experience. You'd be better off spending your hard-earned money elsewhere, where they actually value their customers and deliver on their promises. Save yourself the headache and avoid this company at all costs.
